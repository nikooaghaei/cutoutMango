Please try to complete following:
    Experiments:
        - Test the code on the simple network, with and 
            without masking
        - Test masking with fixed threshold
        - Add a larger network
        - 5/ Change learning rate
        - 3/ Shuffle MANGO data?
        - 5/ Remove other augmentations ?
        - Run with pretrained model as the first phase
    Code:
    (Rating indicated importance level (/5))
        - 5/ Add functionality to both the model and the MANGO to
            be able to continue training from a given checkpoint
            (save checkpoints)
        - 1/ Fix assert warnings. Make sure the code does not run
          if it's going to fail in an upcoming phase
        - 2/ Add tqdm and print out the interesting results such
           as training accuracy, testing accuracy etc.
        - 1/ Fix the comments on the MANGO, describe each function
            remove unnecessary ones
        - 3/ Check the masking functionality
        - 2/ Fix number of workers
        - 1/ Update gitignore for models etc.
        - 4/ Save the model each epoch - override
        - 3/ Seperate training and testing
